title: About
text_about: I am a UI/UX Designer passionate about detail-oriented and user-centered
  design, with special interest in visual design. I have a background in foreign languages
  - during past years I studied at Warsaw and Hamburg University - foreign languages
  and studing abroad helped me to be become a multi-tasker and to easily communicate
  with people from different environments. Then, I moved to the the capital of Germany
  to fullfil my dream about working with people and for people - to become a UX/UI
  designer. I learned design at Ironhack full-time design bootcamp. I'm currently
  working as an intern at PKO Bank Polski in Warsaw.
