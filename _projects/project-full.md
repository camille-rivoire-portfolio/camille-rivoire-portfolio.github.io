  content: Sotonweb is a company based in Southampton, UK, which offers professional
    media design services, such as website design and development, and e-commerce
    and social media support. My task was to design a modern, responsive website,
    that would be also a portfolio, in both desktop and mobile versions. In addition,
    I also have to redesign the existing logo.
