- title: Intro
  content: Sotonweb is a company based in Southampton, UK, which offers professional
    media design services, such as website design and development, and e-commerce
    and social media support. My task was to design a modern, responsive website,
    that would be also a portfolio, in both desktop and mobile versions. In addition,
    I also have to redesign the existing logo.

- title: UX Research & Design process
  background: white
  content: 'My research for this project was mostly based on the visual competitors’
    analysis of the web design agencies. The main features of the majority of the
    websites are vivid colors, big amount of pictures and various animations, but
    sometimes the designs are against UX rules: overlapping texts and images, interactions
    distracting the user from the content instead of enhancing usability, I noticed
    also poor ratio between textes and backgrounds and not harmonic color combinations.
    I wanted my design to bring the fresh feeling of a technology and creative ideas.
    At the same time, I didn’t want the design to overwhelm the portfolio and the
    works of the client. I decided to implement subtle colorful accents, shapes and
    various types of lines and some smooth interactions.'

- title: Logo redesign
  background: purple
  content: According to the client’s request, I redesigned the logo, that looked very
    old-fashioned and not visually appealing. I decided to use lowercase wordmarks,
    which increase perceptions of brand friendliness. I wanted it to look clean and
    modern, and I also implemented a colorful accent - gradient shape, aligned with
    the color palette used for the website.

    The website lets the user easily navigate among four main categories. Each of them can be selected both from the navigation bar or from the homepage. To highlight the most crucial category for the user, informing about the company’s services, I drew the icons and designed the hover effects. The traditional menu in the mobile version has been replaced by the burger one.
